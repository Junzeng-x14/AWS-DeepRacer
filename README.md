## Project Overview
AWS released a car that races on a track based on a deep learning model that is meant to be trained on AWS using SageMaker environment. Deep learning models for self driving cars, are often poor, and generalizing is hard. We explore if MPC (Model Predictive Control) or other control methods may be a more robust solution.

## Implementation
Please check the [wiki page](https://github.com/Junzeng-x14/AWS-DeepRacer/wiki) for further information.
